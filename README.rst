What is OpenSCHC ?
==================

OpenSCHC
--------

OpenSCHC is an open-source implementation of SCHC (Static Context Header Compression) standardized at the IETF by the `LPWAN Working Group <https://tools.ietf.org/wg/lpwan/>`_ as `RFC8724 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8724>`_.
Oversimplifying, this is essentially IP protocol header compression and fragmentation so that they can be transported by low datarate, long range IoT networks.

The long-term goal is to have a stable, open-source, reference Python3 codebase for the SCHC protocol.

.. OpenSCHC is developed to be compatible with MicroPython, on the device side.

OpenSCHC is licensed under the `MIT License <https://github.com/openschc/openschc/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.
