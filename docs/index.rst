What is OpenSCHC ?
==================

OpenSCHC
--------

OpenSCHC is an open-source implementation of SCHC (Static Context Header Compression) standardized at the IETF by the `LPWAN Working Group <https://tools.ietf.org/wg/lpwan/>`_ as `RFC8724 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8724>`_.
Oversimplifying, this is essentially IP protocol header compression and fragmentation so that they can be transported by low datarate, long range IoT networks.

The long-term goal is to have a stable, open-source, reference Python3 codebase for the SCHC protocol.

.. OpenSCHC is developed to be compatible with micropython, on the device side.

Understanding the architecture
------------------------------

A global architecture of the OpenSCHC implementation is shown below:

   :alt: OpenSCHC Architecture

The **Rule Manager** stores a set of Rules and provides methods to install or retrieve Rules.

Rules are composed of two elements:

* A **RuleID** which identifies the Rule by its number, and
* A **content** which contains an array of fields. For details, refer to the `SCHC context data model <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-schc-yang-data-model/?include_text=1>`_.

**App 1 ... App n** are the applications that invoke the **SCHC Orchestrator** to run the necessary SCHC operations, which are briefly defined below:

**Compression** is used on the sender side to compress the header of a packet provided by the App, using a specific rule (identified by its RuleID).
**Decompression**: on the receiver side, upon receiving a compressed packet, the Decompresser is invoked to rebuild the original packet, using the Rule identified by the RuleID carried in the compressed packet.

**Fragmentation** is invoked on the sender side with a RuleID to generate a set of fragments out of a packet (compressed or uncompressed).
**Reassembly** is used on the receiver side to reconstruct the packet out of the set of fragments.

Fragmentation modes and the associated parameters are described in the `SCHC protocol <https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8724>`_ .

**Network Connector** interfaces to a physical model to a real LPWAN network such as LoRa or Sigfox,
or to a link-layer simulator.
